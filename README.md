# vimrc
I can never be without my vimrc, so I made sure it is available to me on every machine as long as it is connected to the internet. And if its not, what the hell am I doing there anyway?

## Usage
https://maxbethke.de/vimrc redirects to the .vimrc file, so one can use

```wget maxbethke.de/vimrc -O ~/.vimrc```
or
```curl maxbethke.de/vimrc -L -o ~/.vimrc```
to activate it for the current user
